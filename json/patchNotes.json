    "body": "<p>Welcome to the second biggest patch of the Forge & Fortune Lifecycle!</p><p><b>Combat</b></p><ul><li>Heroes now have a combat skill, triggered by reaching Max AP. Description of abilities are available on the hero screen. Heroes skill strength is largely determined by total POW.</li><li>Combat system has been updated from time-based to round-based.</li><li>ACT has been replaced by AP Add. Weapon POW is no longer normalized (AKA, the damage you see listed is the damage you deal). AP Add serves a similar purpose to ACT -- the more damage your weapon deals, the less AP it will generate (and thus the less skills your hero will use).</li><li>There are now three dungeons, each containing unique materials. Dungeon floors are random but pre-determined. Dungeons (and bosses) may lock out certain heroes, making them unable to adventure in that dungeon.</li><li>Floors reachable are capped at 50 floors per boss kill. For example, to reach floor 51-100 you'd need to beat the first boss. Bosses are unlockable in the Action League and challenged in the adventure screen.</li><li>Every 50th floor (up until Floor 450) can be converted to a Sanctuary which will heal your heroes upon reaching it. This is purchasable as a Perk in the Action League.</li></ul><p><b>Guilds</b></p><ul><li>The worker item contribution system has been replaced by a crafting guild system. There are five craft guilds, each with two major resources each. (Worker screen and worker auto-contribute were also removed as a consequence).</li><li>Complete guild orders to increase your guild level, unlocking new recipes!</li><li>Workers associated with the guild can be leveled up in the guild for gold once unlocked.</li></ul><p><b>Action League</b></p><ul><li>Tired of just seeing the Action League send you your materials? This is for you!</li><li>Hero experience (and levels) have been removed. Instead, completing dungeons awards you with Notoriety.</li><li>Once the required notoriety thresholds have been reached, Perks will be available for purchase for gold.</li><li>Perks are a permanent content unlock, such as new heroes, new workers, and permanent bonuses. It's also how new bosses become available.</li><li>Notoriety is capped based off bosses slayed. Kill more bosses to increase your notoriety caps!</li></ul><p><b>Town</b></p><ul><li>Town construction has been replaced by a single recipe to be slotted in an action slot (no more nails taking up inventory!)</li></ul><p><b>Recipes</b></p><ul><li>Filters are now more prominent at the top of the recipe screen.</li><li>Recipes are now searchable. Want to know how many recipes contain 'aker' in them? Now it's easy! (Hint: it's three)</li></ul><p><b>User Interface</b></p><ul><li>Improvements to almost every facet of the interface have been implemented.</li><li>Recipes are now shown in card form (to better scale with resolution and provide the content room for future features).</li><li>New icons are next to most headers to improve sexiness</li><li>Animations added to make it as smooth as butter</li><li>Left interface sidebar has been removed to facilitate smaller resolutions (in anticipation of Kongregate port). All information has been moved to the right bar with the exception of workers/materials information -- this is now listed on the recipe screen directly at the very top.</li><li>Footer bar is 1.2x more clickable, Patch notes are now listed in game, and as new patches come out the game should notify you of it (no more checking discord all the time!)</li></ul><p><b>Settings</b></p><ul><li>Battle Log Length: New setting that allows you to set the length of your battle log from 5 entries, up to 999 entries.</li><li>Toggle HP & AP Bars in Combat Area: Want some extra content space, hide the redundant HP and AP bars in the combat area with this setting.</li></ul><p>As always, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for playing our love child and we hope to see you for many patches to come! Make sure to stop by our discord and give us feedback on anything and everything you love or hate.</p><p>- Akerson & Friends</p><p class='hamster'>May the Lettuce be with you!</p>"

    "body": "<p><b>Patch V0.3.1</b></p><p>Welcome to the first major patch in the v0.3 lifecycle, lovingly called the culling! Our focus here was to polish some of the systems we introduced, add some requested QoL features, and generally just tighten up the gameplay experience. We're planning on probably 3 more major patches before we release - one on town progression, one on combat, and a final one on the \"new player experience\". As always, drop us any feedback in discord!</p><p><b>New Building - Magical Desynthesizerr</b></p><p>Starting at tier 2, unlock the new Desynth building! Extract that magical essence out of junk items. What is magical essence for? Who knows!</p><p><b>Hero Overview</b></p><p>You can now get a quick glance at all of your heroes and their stats from the Hero Overview menu on the Heroes screen.</p><p><b>Game Lag Improvements</b></p><p>A lot of optimizations added to the game code to make it run faster, particularly combat but to most facets of the game. Hopefully this reduces or eliminates everyone's \"game slowdown\" that happens until they restart</p><p><b>General Improvements</b></p><ul><li>Guild Order inventory count will now be highlighted green when you can contribute.</li><li>Dungeon Speed now defaults to Fast unless you are viewing, in which case it'll use your selected viewing preference.</li><li>Dungeons now have an \"abandon\" button if you accidentally send out a team. You won't collect rewards but you'll get your workers back.</li><li>Inventory \"Sell All Commons\" button moved to the right to prevent accidental clicks.</li><li>You can now \"Resmith\" at the forge to forge harder and faster.</li><li>A \"Collect All Dungeon Rewards\" button has been added to dungeon mail to quickly collect all dungeon mail.</li><li>You can now unequip gear from the hero screen, hover over the slot and click on the \"Unslot Equipment\" button.</li><li>Added \"Download as File\" for Save Exporting, this will export your save as a .txt file for easy sharing.</li></ul><p><b>Recipe Changes</b></p><p>12 recipes lines have been removed, bringing the total count to 18. All classes now have a standard set of six equipment types to equip, guaranteeing that all your craft you are making are useful somewhere. As a result, weapon lines have been merged into three \"broad\" categories of Heavy (formerly swords, axes, maces, and spears used by Might heroes), Light (whips, daggers, and bows used by Moxie heroes), and Arcane (staves, wands, and rods used by Mind heroes). Any removed items you had equipped will automatically be converted into their appropriate type so no progress is lost.</p><p><b>Material Changes</b></p>\n<ul><li>Materials have been reduced from 6 unique types for each tier to 3 unique types per tier. This effectively halves the number of materials in the game.</li>\n<li>Any materials of the removed type you have will be \"joined\" with one of the remaining ones so no progress is lost.</li></ul><p><b>Guild Changes</b></p><ul><li>Guilds have been renamed to reflect the new Item Types they contain and one guild was removed. The four guilds are now:</li><li>Bird Arms: An avian guild focusing on offensive strategies, selling Arcane, Heavy, Gauntlets, and Thrown items.</li><li>Green Guard: A hamster guild focusing on defensive strategies, selling Helmets, Gloves, Armor, Shoes, and Vests.</li><li>The Cat's Meow: A feline guild focusing on sneakier strategies, selling Light, Hats, Masks, Cloaks, and Belts.</li><li>Trawled Treasures: An aquatic guild focusing on more valuable items, selling Shields, Tomes, Pendants, and Rings</li><li>Levels of guilds have been reduced to reflect the lower number of recipes to unlock. Levels of guilds have been reset to reflect the highest level of a currently owned recipe (thus no progress is lost). Some people will have \"boosted\" levels due to the restructuring and will have recipes to buy immediately.</li></ul><p><b>Worker Changes</b></p><ul><li>Resources (ore, wood, herb, lumber, etc) have been removed. Instead, recipes require workers from the 5 crafting guilds who are just assigned to a guild. For example, a Knife requires a worker from The Cat's Meow guild. This should clarify the resource-allocation sub-system that exists for recipes and alleviate some resource bottlenecks.</li><li>Worker counts for each guild are available on the sidebar.</li><li>Workers in each guild will show what they're currently working on.</li><li>Workers must be re-bought to unlock.</li></ul><p><b>Fixes</b></p><ul><li>Fixed issue with material amount tooltip on \"Materials Found In This Dungeon\" dropdown causing content overflow.</li><li>Fixed issue with \"Overall\" progress bar not being proper color upon 100% completion.</li><li>Fixed issue with Boss dungeons causing 404 error for a non-existent image</li><li>Fixed missing icon for healing in battle logs</li><li>Removed level on town building build cards</li><li>Hotkeys will no longer be triggered when inputting numbers in search bar</li></ul>"

    "body": "<p>Hi everyone, we're back for another major update! This marks the V0.3.2 release, which was our building sweep/overhaul. Our goal with this patch is to do a last-pass sweep at the town with two goals in mind: First, we wanted to tier building progression so buildings have room to grow over time, and secondly we wanted to make sure we were happy with current designs. That said, this patch also snuck in a few more major changes!</p><p><b>Building Changes</b></p><ul><li>Adjusted the tiers some buildings unlock at, and added additional \"building levels\" at higher tiers. The levels are as follows:</li><li>Bank: 15/20/25 Bank Slots</li><li>Fusion Cabin: 2/3/4 Fusion Slots</li><li>Forge: Max enhancement of +3/+6/+10</li><li>Fortune: 1/2/3 Fortune Slots</li></ul><p><b>New Building: Tinker Hut</b></p><p>The Tinker Hut brings a way to use your junk commons and desynth materials into a new equipment type - the trinket! Trinkets feature secondary stats (crit, armor, and spow) and rather than having a rarity/enhancement level they have a star rating (currently capped at 100). Crafting more trinkets increases your mastery and your minimum star value, and leveling the Tinker Hut increases the maximum star value. With enough crafts, you will always make 100 star trinkets!</p><p><b>Building Improvements: The Forge</b></p><p>The forge is no longer a success system - instead, paying a hefty gold and material cost will permanently increase your gear. Use it when you're stuck and need a little push advancing!</p><p><b>Building Improvements: Fusion Cabin</b></p><p>The fusion cauldron has been renamed the fusion cabin and now features a \"two-click\" system to slot and start your fuses -- no more accidental fusings!</p><p><b>Building Improvements: The Fortune</b></p><p>The fortune teller has gotten a facelift and has some new tricks up her sleeve -- now, sacrificing an item will increase the proc chance of the next higher rarity for a certain number of crafts. Want more epic knives? Sacrifice a great one!</p><p>Also coming in a future update in the v0.3.2.x cycle will be a building to re-challenge old bosses for big rewards! Stay tuned!<p><b>Dungeon Collect Screen</b></p><p>No longer will Action League mail get sent to your spam folder! When an adventure is complete, it'll be available to collect (and repeat!) right in the dungeon screen. Boss fights also will tell you remaining HP% to help you gauge your progress!</p><p><b>Material and Mastery Changes</b></p><ul><li>Materials are now capped at 1000.</li><li>Mastery now takes a sliding scale of the appropriate material to master -- if you've never crafted the item it will take 1000 material, down to a minimum 100 material once you've crafted 100 of them. Use your materials strategically to master critical items quicker!</li></ul><p><b>Stat Changes</b></p><ul><li>Stat \"words' (like crit) have been replaced with a pictorial counterpart, and all stats icons got a facelift to match the game aethestic.</li><li>New stat: spow! Spow is like POW but it is used ONLY on special attacks. Use it to boost your specials with an extra punch!</li><li>Critdmg has been removed as a visible stat and has been adjusted to 1.5x for all heroes. Bosses can still have varying critdmg levels.</li></ul><p>As always thanks for playing and if you have any questions/comments/conerns/bugs let us know in Discord!</p>"
